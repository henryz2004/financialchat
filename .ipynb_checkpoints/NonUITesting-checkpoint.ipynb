      "Title: Chinese companies resort to repurposing Nvidia gaming chips for AI\n",
      "Excerpt:Chinese companies are resorting to chips repurposed from standard PC gaming products to develop artificial intelligence tools, after Washington blocked US exports of high-performance processors.\n",
      "Thousands of Nvidia gaming graphics cards are being stripped of their core components in factories and workshops every month, before being installed on new circuit boards, according to two factory managers and two chip buyers familiar with the situation.\n",
      "Industry experts said the repurposing of chips from cards designed to be slotted into consumer PC motherboards to improve gaming graphics amounted to a rough workaround to tackle the lack of high-end processors in China.\n",
      "While Nvidia’s gamer-focused products have raw computing power, they are not as capable in the high-precision calculations needed for training some large language models with bigger data sets. Due to the limits of interconnection speeds between chips, it is also challenging to overcome this by simply grouping more chips in computing clusters.\n",
      "“This is a desperate move by Chinese companies under the export controls. Just like using a kitchen knife to create artwork, it’s doable, but the effect is suboptimal,” said Charlie Chai, an analyst at research group 86Research.\n",
      "However, the options for migrating to China’s alternative chip ecosystem under development are limited, leading some companies to turn to Nvidia’s less expensive gaming chips.\n",
      "“We don’t know whether such a reinvention will be successful, but we hope that these machines will be usable, at least in the short term,” said a buyer.\n",

      "Happy New Year Swampians! We are glad to be back, and buckling in for what will be an eventful, and most likely exhausting, year of coverage — including the biggest election period in human history, two hot wars, more trade frictions and (on the upside) the possibility of a soft landing despite it all. I wanted to start this first Note of 2024 by laying out some political and economic predictions for the next 12 months, letting you know what’s on my coverage radar — and asking for your thoughts about topics you’d like to hear more about. My colleague Peter Spiegel, the head of our US operation, will be my partner this week, sitting in for Ed Luce.\n",
      "So, let me start with three initial predictions for the coming year: \n",
      "1. The rubber hits the road on trade\n",
      "You might think this is already the case, given the last several years of US-China decoupling. But I think globalisation will continue to be under fire, and we will see new export controls, investment restrictions and a global drive for more national and regional self-sufficiency. This trend will continue, albeit in different forms, no matter who wins the presidential election in November.\n",

      "Good morning. Say what you will about the finance industry, there is one thing it can do well: stitch together barely related, marginally relevant buzzwords when naming a new product. Behold the BTC Private Credit Fund LP, billed as the “first bitcoin private credit fund”. As far as we can tell, the fund — a standard bitcoin lending operation — has nothing to do with private credit as that term is generally understood. But how, you may be asking yourself, can a self-respecting piece of financial marketing in 2023 not include a reference to AI? Well, BPCF has that box checked by having OpenAI CEO Sam Altman as a backer. What a time to be alive. Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and ethan.wu@ft.com.\n",
      "Friday interview: Claudia Sahm \n",
      "Claudia Sahm is, perhaps to her chagrin, best known for creating the eponymous Sahm rule, a recession marker developed as part of a discussion of economic stabilisation payments to individuals. She is almost as well known for taking a contrarian view of the policy response to the coronavirus pandemic. She argued early on that the bulk of the post-pandemic inflation was driven by supply constraints that would pass, and urged policymakers not to overreact. Below she offers views on whether the inflation fight is won, productivity, consumer sentiment, the Phillips curve and much else. \n",
