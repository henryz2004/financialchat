      "Title: Chinese companies resort to repurposing Nvidia gaming chips for AI\n",
      "Excerpt:Chinese companies are resorting to chips repurposed from standard PC gaming products to develop artificial intelligence tools, after Washington blocked US exports of high-performance processors.\n",
      "Thousands of Nvidia gaming graphics cards are being stripped of their core components in factories and workshops every month, before being installed on new circuit boards, according to two factory managers and two chip buyers familiar with the situation.\n",
      "Industry experts said the repurposing of chips from cards designed to be slotted into consumer PC motherboards to improve gaming graphics amounted to a rough workaround to tackle the lack of high-end processors in China.\n",
      "While Nvidia’s gamer-focused products have raw computing power, they are not as capable in the high-precision calculations needed for training some large language models with bigger data sets. Due to the limits of interconnection speeds between chips, it is also challenging to overcome this by simply grouping more chips in computing clusters.\n",
      "“This is a desperate move by Chinese companies under the export controls. Just like using a kitchen knife to create artwork, it’s doable, but the effect is suboptimal,” said Charlie Chai, an analyst at research group 86Research.\n",
      "The Biden administration tightened export controls for cutting-edge AI chips in October, making it more difficult for chip companies such as Nvidia to sell high-performance semiconductors to China.\n",
      "Demand for the graphics processing units sourced from the gaming cards has surged in the past month, according to people familiar with the situation. One of the factory managers said workers had disassembled more than 4,000 Nvidia gaming cards in December, more than four times the number in November.\n",
      "‘Tech cold war’: rising tensions in the critical chip industry\n",
      "How the US chip export controls have turned the screws on China\n",
      "However, the performance of these chips is substantially weaker than those previously sold in China, and they will not be widely available until March, according to three people familiar with the situation.\n",
      "Chinese customers have also objected to the prices Nvidia hopes to set for these inferior processors, which are close to those of their more powerful banned counterparts, the three people said.\n",
      "However, the options for migrating to China’s alternative chip ecosystem under development are limited, leading some companies to turn to Nvidia’s less expensive gaming chips.\n",

      "Happy New Year Swampians! We are glad to be back, and buckling in for what will be an eventful, and most likely exhausting, year of coverage — including the biggest election period in human history, two hot wars, more trade frictions and (on the upside) the possibility of a soft landing despite it all. I wanted to start this first Note of 2024 by laying out some political and economic predictions for the next 12 months, letting you know what’s on my coverage radar — and asking for your thoughts about topics you’d like to hear more about. My colleague Peter Spiegel, the head of our US operation, will be my partner this week, sitting in for Ed Luce.\n",
      "So, let me start with three initial predictions for the coming year: \n",
      "1. The rubber hits the road on trade\n",
      "You might think this is already the case, given the last several years of US-China decoupling. But I think globalisation will continue to be under fire, and we will see new export controls, investment restrictions and a global drive for more national and regional self-sufficiency. This trend will continue, albeit in different forms, no matter who wins the presidential election in November.\n",
      "It will be driven as much from China as from the US, which needs to spell out what its trade policy in the post-neoliberal era really is. The hoopla over Nippon Steel’s bid for US Steel is a case in point — the administration has been saying we need to make new trade alliances to counter China, but is balking at a bid from a Japanese company. There may be very good reasons for this (like the chance that Nippon would try to put more jobs in the US south’s “right to work” states, which would go against the administration’s pro-union stance). But this draws home the point that the White House needs to start putting meat on the bones of what a “postcolonial” trade paradigm really means. (I’ll come back to this topic in a column soon.) Otherwise, allies will become rightfully concerned about protectionism and xenophobia.\n",
      "2. The end of corporate virtue signalling\n",
      "In response to “Is Bidenomics dead on arrival?”:\n",
      "“While the economic discomfort being felt by the American voter blinds them to the value of Bidenomics, the value of it needs to be communicated in the manner Rana articulates in her penultimate paragraph and needs to be appreciated by the voters in America. Off the top of my head, I’d suggest Bidenomics is replaced with Humanomics, and then campaigning that makes clear the humanity In Biden’s economic policies. The courage he shows in implementing long-term economic changes that will benefit the children and grandchildren of today’s voters will be appreciated by the many voters who anguish about the world they are leaving [behind]. However, to Rana’s point, the people who care about this are not getting the message. That needs to change.” — Mel Gardner\n",
      "Your feedback\n",
      "We'd love to hear from you. You can email the team on swampnotes@ft.com, contact Peter Spiegel on peter.spiegel@ft.com and Rana on rana.foroohar@ft.com, and follow them on X at @RanaForoohar and @SpiegelPeter. We may feature an excerpt of your response in the next newsletter\n",

      "Good morning. Say what you will about the finance industry, there is one thing it can do well: stitch together barely related, marginally relevant buzzwords when naming a new product. Behold the BTC Private Credit Fund LP, billed as the “first bitcoin private credit fund”. As far as we can tell, the fund — a standard bitcoin lending operation — has nothing to do with private credit as that term is generally understood. But how, you may be asking yourself, can a self-respecting piece of financial marketing in 2023 not include a reference to AI? Well, BPCF has that box checked by having OpenAI CEO Sam Altman as a backer. What a time to be alive. Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and ethan.wu@ft.com.\n",
      "Friday interview: Claudia Sahm \n",
      "Claudia Sahm is, perhaps to her chagrin, best known for creating the eponymous Sahm rule, a recession marker developed as part of a discussion of economic stabilisation payments to individuals. She is almost as well known for taking a contrarian view of the policy response to the coronavirus pandemic. She argued early on that the bulk of the post-pandemic inflation was driven by supply constraints that would pass, and urged policymakers not to overreact. Below she offers views on whether the inflation fight is won, productivity, consumer sentiment, the Phillips curve and much else. \n",
      "Her comments have been edited for brevity and clarity. \n",
      "Unhedged: Have we landed softly?\n",
      "Claudia Sahm: The soft landing is not here yet. But it is in the bag. Barring an unforeseen massive disruption, we are landing this plane. Now, there’ll be some turbulence as we approach the runway. I fully expect we’re going to have some disappointing reads on inflation. To me, a soft landing is 2 per cent inflation or spitting distance, say under 2.5 per cent, while unemployment stays low, right around 4 per cent or below. We’ll have it next year. You can see the landing strip. \n",

      "As an AI, I don't have real-time data access. However, the most recent information I can provide is based on articles found through a search. According to recent reports, the US economy is facing several challenges. One area of concern is the impact of export controls on high-performance processors, which has led to Chinese companies resorting to repurposing gaming chips for their artificial intelligence needs. The Biden administration implemented tighter export controls on cutting-edge AI chips, making it more difficult for chip companies like Nvidia to sell high-performance semiconductors to China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there are predictions for changes in trade policies and global self-sufficiency in response to ongoing tensions between the US and China. There may be new export controls, investment restrictions, and a drive for national and regional self-sufficiency, regardless of who wins the presidential election.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also worth noting that there are discussions about the end of corporate virtue signaling and the need for clarity on the US's trade policy in the post-neoliberal era.\n",
